Here are the relevant parts of Dovecot v2.1.x configuration for Postfixadmin setup.

Please refer to Dovecot documentation for complete information.

The setup gets userdb and passdb info from MySQL as well as quotas, and 
uses dict backend to store used quotas as key=value pairs so that they can
be viewed real-time in Postfixadmin.


1. Dovecot setup
-----------------

A basic /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf is as follows, this was generated using 'dovecot -n' on a vanilla install and then
changing to talk to a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. 

# BEGIN /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf:
# Change this to where your mail root is, this needs to match whatever structure postfix expects....

mail_location = maildir:/var/mail/vmail/%u/

namespace inbox {
  inbox = yes
  location = 
  mailbox Drafts {
    special_use = \Drafts
  }
  mailbox Junk {
    special_use = \Junk
  }
  mailbox Sent {
    special_use = \Sent
  }
  mailbox "Sent Messages" {
    special_use = \Sent
  }
  mailbox Trash {
    special_use = \Trash
  }
  prefix = 
}

protocols = "imap pop3"
# change to 'no' if you don't have ssl cert/keys, and comment out ssl_cert/ssl_key
ssl = yes 
ssl_cert = </etc/dovecot/private/dovecot.pem
ssl_key = </etc/dovecot/private/dovecot.pem

# login is for outlook express smtpd auth
auth_mechanisms = plain login

# If you're having trouble, try uncommenting these :
#auth_debug = yes
#auth_debug_passwords = yes

userdb { 
    driver = sql
    args = /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf 
}

passdb { 
    driver = sql
    args = /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf 
}

# Uncomment this if you want Postfix to be able to do smtpd auth through dovecot
# At a minimum Postfix probably needs : smtpd_sasl_type = dovecot 
# And additionally: smtpd_sasl_path = private/auth
#service auth {
#    unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
#        mode = 0660
#        user = postfix
#        group = postfix
#    }
#    user = postfix
#    group = postfix
#}

# Needs to match Postfix virtual_uid_maps
first_valid_uid = 1001 

# allow plaintext auth (change to 'yes' to block plaintext passwords)
disable_plaintext_auth = no

#END


2. Dovecot *sql setup
----------------------

Below you'll find the relevant part of dovecot-sql.conf file regarding our
setup. 

Things you will probably need to change are db connection settings (connect=)
and the default_pass_scheme.

#BEGIN /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf

connect = host=localhost dbname=postfix user=postfix password=postfix
# Use either 
driver = mysql
# Or 
# driver = pgsql

# Default password scheme - change to match your Postfixadmin setting.
# depends on your $CONF['encrypt'] setting:
# md5crypt  -> MD5-CRYPT
# md5       -> PLAIN-MD5
# cleartext -> PLAIN
default_pass_scheme = MD5-CRYPT

# Query to retrieve password. user can be used to retrieve username in other
# formats also.

password_query = SELECT username AS user,password FROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u' AND active='1'

# Query to retrieve user information, note uid matches dovecot.conf AND Postfix virtual_uid_maps parameter.
user_query = SELECT maildir, 1001 AS uid, 1001 AS gid FROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u' AND active='1'


# MYSQL :
user_query = SELECT CONCAT('/var/vmail/mail/', maildir) AS home, 1001 AS uid, 1001 AS gid, 
	CONCAT('*:bytes=', quota) AS quota_rule FROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u' AND active='1'
# PostgreSQL : (no Quota though) :
# user_query = SELECT '/var/vmail/mail/' || maildir AS home, 1001 as uid, 1001 as gid FROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u' AND active = '1'

#END /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf





3. Dovecot v1.0 quota support (optional)
----------------------------------------

Please note that you need to use Dovecot's own local delivery agent to
enforce and update quotas. Then you can view real-time used quotas in
Postfixadmin.

Add to dovecot.conf:

## IMAP quota
protocol imap {
  quota = dict:storage=200000 proxy::quota
}

## POP quota
protocol pop3 {
  mail_plugins = quota
}

## Local Delivery Agent
protocol lda {
  mail_plugins = quota
}

## Dictionary DB proxy
dict {
  quota = mysql:/etc/dovecot-dict-quota.conf
}

## Default quota values
plugin {
quota = dict:storage=200000 proxy::quota
}


Change dovecot-sql.conf to return quota values:

for MySQL:
user_query = SELECT maildir, 1001 AS uid, 1001 AS gid, CONCAT('dict:storage=',floor(quota/1000),' proxy::quota') as quota FROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u' AND active='1'

for PostgreSQL:
user_query = SELECT maildir, 1001 AS uid, 1001 AS gid, 'dict:storage=' || floor(quota/1000) || '::proxy::quota' as quota FROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u' AND active='1'


Create file dovecot-dict-quota.conf:

driver = mysql
connect = host=localhost dbname=postfix user=postfix password=postfix
default_pass_scheme = MD5-CRYPT
table = quota
select_field = current
where_field = path
username_field = username


Create database in Mysql:
(This is automatically done by postfixadmin's setup.php)

Enable quota support in Postfixadmin config.inc.php:

$CONF['used_quotas'] = 'YES';
$CONF['quota'] = 'YES';

Note: The above text describes the configuration for dovecot 1.0 & 1.1 quota table format.

If you use dovecot 1.2 or newer, 
- use the 'quota2' table (also created by setup.php)
- set $CONF['new_quota_table'] = 'YES'
