----------------
When this is an upgrade from Postfix Admin 1.5.4 please read UPGRADE.TXT!!

More information is available on http://high5.net/howto/


1. Modify main.cf
-----------------
In order for Postfix to use MySQL for relay_domains add the following
to your main.cf

relay_domains = proxy:mysql:/usr/local/etc/postfix/mysql_relay_domains_maps.cf


2. mysql_relay_domains_maps.cf
------------------------------
You will need to put this into a text file for postfix to pickup.

user = postfix
password = postfix
hosts = localhost
dbname = postfix
table = domain
select_field = domain
where_field = domain
additional_conditions = and backupmx = '1'


3. Restart Postfix
-------------------
When you are done make sure to restart Postfix so the changes take effect.
